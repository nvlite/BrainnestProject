                    <p> The word halcyon comes from a story in Greek mythology about the halcyon bird, which had the power to calm the rough ocean waves every December so she could nest. In Greece these days come around early January </p>

                <li> Goblin mode is a neologism for the rejection of societal expectations and the act of living in an unkempt, hedonistic manner without concern for one's self-image. </li>

               <p>Here is a quote from the Smithsonian website:</p>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/goblin-mode-selected-as-oxfords-2022-word-of-the-year-180981245/#:~:text=The%20term%20is%20defined%20as,a%20statement%20from%20Oxford%20Languages">
                    For the first time in history, Oxford Dictionaries allowed the public to vote on its 2022 word of the year. The winner: “goblin mode.”

                <li>destruction of an employer's property (such as tools or materials) or the hindering of manufacturing by discontented workers </li>

                <li> destructive or obstructive action carried on by a civilian or enemy agent to hinder a nation's war effort </li>

                <li> an act or process tending to hamper or hurt</li>

                <li> deliberate subversion</li>
           <p> One theory related to the invention of the Jacquard loom by Frenchman Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1801. The Jacquard loom uses punch cards to automate the raising and lowering of warp threads,
            allowing one to achieve many more sheds than a human weaver could ever grapple with. This invention, however, put many textile workers out of a job. The theory is that these employees threw their wooden clogs 
            (the French word for these clogs is “sabots”) into the delicate machinery to wreak havoc. </p>
